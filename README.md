# A repo to test stale-image-remover action

This repo is used to test out the [stale-image-remover](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/stale-image-remover) action.

The repo has a few files in the `/images` directory, and we want to test if they'll be deleted in a PR.

`pic1.png` is a reference to the first, so keep that one around.

`pic3.png` should be kept around now...
